<h2>Persona 1-Cassie </h2>

       
<p>
Cassie is a 23 year old, married, female, who has a energetic two year old boy running around her house. He has zero patience for getting dressed each morning. Cassie needs to be able to choose one outfit for the day because there is no way she's going to be able to tie
him down long enough to change his clothes later on. He's busy, and loves being outdoors in the dirt, the grass, sand, bascially any and everywhere he can reach, and in the country that means A LOT of places to run. Cassie also farms for her parents and the two year old is always there to tag along. Cassie knows 
she'll have to wear pants, but what top should she wear? What's the weather going to look like? What should she dress little man in?

    <h2>Persona 2-Kate </h2>
               <p>
        Kate is a 30 year old married, female who absolutely adores her three children. They are her life and she stays busy from the moment she wakes up each day to the time she goes to bed. She is back in school finishing her bachelors degree, while homeschooling her 
        two oldest children WHILE making a home for her family. She's busy, but she knows it will all be worth it. Kate has to plan her time effectively to manage the many demands on her plate. Schedules are great, but she also needs to make sure there isn't wasted time spent
        on doing extra laundry. This is a task right now because the five year old loves to change multiple times a day depending on the weather, and every piece that is taken off ends up in the laundry basket. Kate would love to show her five year old what the weather is going to 
        look like and help him make a decision on one outfit each day rather than the three or four he normally sports.

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Mom has a busy day ahead, which includes a list of errands and a cute crew, all under 10. She wants to make sure all their needs are met, including the appropriate clothing.</li>
            <li>Dad gets to hang out with the kiddos while Mom spends the day with her sisters. He wants to show his kids how cool he is and take them to the zoo, out for ice cream and maybe even a drive-in movie but with the wife gone, how will he know what clothing choices he should make for them?</li>
            <li>The kids just want to play outside! Rather than have them change their clothes multiple times a day- that just adds to the laundry pile, Mom needs to know what clothing recommendations to make!</li>
            <li>The family vacation has finally arrived, but the hardest part has also presented itself, packing for an entire week! What do we wear?</li>
            <li>Mom decided to get up a little early today, and while it's still chilly outside, she really doesn't want to have to change her clothes again, so rather than be too hot or too cold all day, she'd love to know how to dress appropriately.</li>
        </ul>
